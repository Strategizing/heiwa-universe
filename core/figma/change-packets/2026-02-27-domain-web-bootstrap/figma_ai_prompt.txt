Update the Heiwa architecture board to match current runtime topology.

Scope to update:
1) Add a domain edge layer for root domain heiwa.ltd with four subdomains:
   - status.heiwa.ltd -> Cloudflare Pages project "heiwa-clients" (public read-only status)
   - auth.heiwa.ltd -> Railway "heiwa-cloud-hq" auth edge route
   - api.heiwa.ltd -> Railway "heiwa-cloud-hq" API ingress behind Cloudflare proxy/WAF
   - docs.heiwa.ltd -> Cloudflare Pages docs surface
2) Add an operator identity-routing layer sourced from core/config/identity_profiles.json:
   - default identity: operator-general
   - domain-web-initializer identity routes to CI + Discord engineering lane
3) Show OpenClaw and PicoClaw as orchestration routers pointing to /Users/dmcgregsauce/heiwa as workspace root and identity map source.
4) Keep portability boundary explicit: runtime/deploy paths must not depend on ~/.codex/heiwa operator state.

Design intent:
- Keep this as an architecture/system map, not UI mockups.
- Distinguish read-only status surfaces vs privileged control-plane paths.
