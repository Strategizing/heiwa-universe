# Heiwa Limited (The Source)

**Status:** Classified / Headless
**Architecture:** Decentralized Execution Mesh (v2.0)
**Topology:** DOE Protocol (Directive -> Orchestration -> Execution)

> **The Repository is the Reality.**

This repository serves as the **Single Source of Truth** for Heiwa code logic, orchestration contracts, and runtime entrypoints. It does **not** contain committed production secrets.

## Architecture

Refer to:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` for topology and DOE flow
- `docs/platform/CANONICAL_RUNTIME_MAP_V1.md` for canonical V1 runtime ownership/entrypoints
- `docs/platform/DEPRECATIONS_V1.md` for legacy compatibility paths and migration targets
- `docs/OPERABILITY_BASELINE_2026-02-17.md` for current known-good/known-bad state
- `docs/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md` for day-to-day command usage across Railway/OpenClaw/PicoClaw/Ollama/Codex
- `docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` for current deploy runbook
- `docs/PERSISTENT_CONTROL_PLANE_WORKERS.md` for the fastest production path (Railway control plane + Mac/PC workers)

### Core Components
- **`fleets/`**: The specialized agent code (Cloud HQ, Field Ops).
- **`libs/`**: Shared SDKs and utilities (`heiwa_sdk`).
- **`skills/`**: Capability modules for agents.
- **`cli/scripts/`**: Health checks, verification, and operator tooling.

## Operations

This repo is runnable locally for operator checks and node runtime.

### The Node (Macbook)
To run local checks and startup:
```bash
cd ~/heiwa-limited
./cli/heiwa doctor
./cli/heiwa up
./cli/heiwa worker
```

For persistent local workers + readiness checks:
```bash
bash cli/scripts/ops/start_worker_stack.sh
python3 cli/scripts/ops/heiwa_360_check.py
```

### The Hub (Railway)
Deploys are managed via the `heiwa-cloud-hq` Railway service from this repository.

## Contribution
1. **Core Agents**: Add or update agent behavior in `fleets/hub/agents/`.
2. **Skills**: Define new agent capabilities in `skills/`.
3. **Shared Contracts**: Keep SDK and protocol changes aligned in `libs/heiwa_sdk/` and `fleets/hub/protocol.py`.
